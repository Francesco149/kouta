dependencies: SDL2

should be compatible at least with x86/x86\_64 windows, linux, freebsd
with gcc, clang, msvc

# compiling
just run ```./build``` . it's aware of ```CC```, ```CFLAGS```,
```LDFLAGS``` in case you need to override anything

if you compile with ```./build -DKT_DEBUG``` you will get a full trace
on stdout (SLOW!) which is handy for debugging
